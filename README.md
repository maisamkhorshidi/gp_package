## Overview

**GenForge** is a powerful Python package designed to push the boundaries of Genetic Programming (GP) through innovative techniques, such as multi-population approaches and solution forging. Whether you're an academic, researcher, or industry professional, GenForge provides a robust framework for developing, analyzing, and deploying GP-based solutions.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Population Genetic Programming**: Harness the power of multiple populations to evolve solutions more efficiently.
- **Dynamic Solution Forging**: Integrate information-theoretic techniques to forge optimized solutions from complex data sets.
- **Educational Capabilities**: Ideal for learning and teaching genetic programming, with well-structured, modular code.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for small-scale research projects as well as large, industrial-grade applications.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Built-in tools to visualize the evolution of populations and fitness metrics across generations.
